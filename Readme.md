**Reasonable Standard* for CSS Stylesheet Structure.**

Problem
-------

Any CSS greater than 1000 lines will get unwieldy. You'll eventually run into these common pitfalls:

* "What does this class mean?"
* "Is this class still being used?"
* "If I make a new class `green`, will there be a clash?"

<br>

Structure
---------

### Think in components

![](images/component-example.png)

Think of each piece of your UI as an individual "component." Components will be named with **at least two words**, separated by a dash. Examples of a component:

* A like button (`.like-button`)
* A search form (`.search-form`)
* A news article card (`.article-card`)

### Elements

![](images/component-elements.png)

**Naming:** Each component may have elements. They should have classes that are only **one word**.

```scss
.search-form {
  > .field { /* ... */ }
  > .action { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Selectors:** Prefer to use the `>` child selector whenever possible. This prevents bleeding through nested components, and performs better than descendant selectors.

```scss
.article-card {
  .title     { /* okay */ }
  > .author  { /* ✓ better */ }
}
```

**On multiple words:** For those that need two or more words, concatenate them without dashes or underscores.

```scss
.profile-box {
  > .firstname { /* ... */ }
  > .lastname { /* ... */ }
  > .avatar { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Avoid tag selectors:** use classnames whenever possible. Tag selectors are fine, but they may come at a small performance penalty and may not be as descriptive.

```scss
.article-card {
  > h3    { /* ... */ }
  > .name { /* ✓ better */ }
}
```

### Variants

![](images/component-modifiers.png)

Components may have variants. Their classes will be prefixed by a dash (`-`).

```scss
.like-button {
  &.-wide { /* ... */ }
  &.-short { /* ... */ }
  &.-disabled { /* ... */ }
}
```

Elements may also have variants.

```scss
.shopping-card {
  > .title { /* ... */ }
  > .title.-small { /* ... */ }
}
```

Why a dash? Because:

* it prevents ambiguity with elements
* a CSS class can only start with a letter, `_` or `-`
* dashes are easier to type than underscores
* it kind of resembles switches in UNIX commands (`gcc -O2 -Wall -emit-last`)

### Nested components

![](images/component-nesting.png)

Sometimes it's necessary to nest components.

```html
<div class='article-link'>
  <div class='vote-box'>
    ...
  </div>
  <h3 class='title'>...</h3>
  <p class='meta'>...</p>
</div>
```

### Simplifying nested components

Sometimes, when nesting components, your markup can get dirty:

```html
<div class='search-form'>
  <input class='input' type='text'>
  <button class='search-button -red -large'></button>
</div>
```

You can simplify this by using your CSS preprocessor's `@extend` mechanism:

```html
<div class='search-form'>
  <input class='input' type='text'>
  <button class='submit'></button>
</div>
```

```scss
// sass
.search-form {
  > .submit {
    @extend .search-button;
    @extend .search-button.-red;
    @extend .search-button.-large;
  }
}
```

### Layout

![](images/layouts.png)

**Avoid positioning properties:** Components should be made in a way that they're reusable in different contexts. Avoid putting these properties in components:

* Positioning (`position`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`)
* Floats (`float`, `clear`)
* Margins (`margin`)
* Dimensions (`width`, `height`) *

**Fixed dimensions:** Exception to these would be elements that have fixed width/heights, such as avatars and logos.

**Define positioning in parents:** If you need to define these, try to define them in whatever context whey will be in. In this example below, notice that the widths and floats are applied on the *list* component, not the component itself.

```css
.article-list {
  & {
    @include clearfix;
  }

  > .article-card {
    width: 33.3%;
    float: left;
  }
}

.article-card {
  & { /* ... */ }
  > .image { /* ... */ }
  > .title { /* ... */ }
  > .category { /* ... */ }
}
```

<br>

CSS structure
-------------

### One component per file

```scss
/* css/components/search-form.scss */
.search-form {
  > .button { /* ... */ }
  > .field { /* ... */ }
  > .label { /* ... */ }

  // variants
  &.-small { /* ... */ }
  &.-wide { /* ... */ }
}
```

In sass-rails and stylus, this makes including all of them easy:

```scss
@import 'components/*';
```

### Avoid over-nesting

Use no more than 1 level of nesting. It's easy to get lost with too much nesting.

```scss
/* bad */
.image-frame {
  > .description {
    /* ... */

    > .icon {
      /* ... */
    }
  }
}
```

Consider instead:

```scss
.image-frame {
  > .description { /* ... */ }
  > .description > .icon { /* ... */ }
}
```

<br>

Pitfalls
--------

### Bleeding through nested components

Be careful about nested components where the nested component has an element of the same name.

```html
<article class='article-link'>
  <div class='vote-box'>
    <button class='up'></button>
    <button class='down'></button>
    <span class='count'>4</span>
  </div>

  <h3 class='title'>Article title</h3>
  <p class='count'>3 votes</p>
</article>
```

```scss
.article-link {
  > .title { /* ... */ }
  > .count { /* ... (!!!) */ }
}

.vote-button {
  > .up { /* ... */ }
  > .down { /* ... */ }
  > .count { /* ... */ }
}
```

In this case, if `.article-link > .count` did not have the `>` (child) selector, it will also apply to the `.vote-button .count` element. This is one of the reasons why child selectors are preferred.

<br>

But...
------

Some people may have apprehensions to these convention, such as:

### But dashes suck

You're free to omit it and just use regular words, but keep the rest of the ideas in place (components, elements, variants).

### But I can't think of 2 words

Some components will only need one word to express their purpose, such as `alert`. In these cases, consider that using some suffixes will make it clearer that it's a block-level element:

* `.alert-box`
* `.alert-card`
* `.alert-block`

Or for inlines:

* `.link-button`
* `.link-span`

<br>

Other solutions
---------------

### BEM

[BEM] in nice, but some may be irked at its unconventional syntax. RSCSS pretty much follows BEM conventions, only with a different syntax.

```html
<!-- BEM -->
<form class='site-search site-search--full'>
  <input  class='site-search__field' type='text'>
  <button class='site-search__button'></button>
</form>
```

```html
<!-- rscss -->
<form class='site-search -full'>
  <input  class='field' type='text'>
  <button class='button'></button>
</form>
```

### Terminologies

The same concepts exist in similar ways in other CSS structuring ideologies.

| RSCSS     | BEM      | SMACSS        |
| ---       | ---      | ---           |
| Component | Block    | Module        |
| Element   | Element  | ?             |
| Layout    | ?        | Layout        |
| Variant   | Modifier | Theme & State |

<br>

Summary
-------

* Think in **components**, named with 2 words (`.screenshot-image`)
* Components have **elements**, named with 1 word (`.blog-post .title`)
* Name **variants** with a dash prefix (`.shop-banner.-with-icon`)
* Components can nest
* Remember you can extend to make things simple
